## OCRcpt

# About
We designed a bill-splitting app that use computer vision techniques to translate paper receipts into text. Using items from a receipts, we enable groups of users to split restaurant tabs, monthly bills, and other transactions.

The app was developed in Xcode, and the receipt OCR reader was created using Python, Google Vision API and Google Cloud Storage and Firebase.

We plan to implement an Apple Pay or Venmo API to automate the billing process and create a planner for helping with recurring payments in the future

Created for CalHacks 5.0

# Features
Split bills across a party of users
Read receipts, and assign dishes to individuals to pay for
Recurring payments (e.g. bills)

# Quickstart
Open OCRcpt.xcworkspace in Xcode and run!

Start by either scanning a receipt, or by adding purchases manually by pressing the button in the top right. From there, we can add people that we want to split the bill with, and we can determine how we want to split up the purchases.
